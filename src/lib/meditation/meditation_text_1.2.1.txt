Welcome back ! [pause 2 seconds]

Today, we’re going to focus on a key skill…

Noticing your thoughts — without reacting to them. [pause 3 seconds]

In a busy world, thoughts can steal your focus

Trigger stress…

Or cause confusion. [pause 3 seconds]

Mindfulness trains you to step back…

It’s a way to observe distractions without reacting…

And return to what really matters: your clarity and focus. [pause 3 seconds]

Let’s begin. [pause 2 seconds]

Find a comfortable position…

[pause 2 seconds]

Sit upright, yet relaxed…

And if you like, gently close your eyes… [pause 3 seconds]

Take a slow, deep breath in… [pause 3 seconds]

And exhale gently… [pause 3 seconds]

in again… [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 1 seconds]

and out… [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 2 seconds]

Now let your breathing settle into a natural rhythm… [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 3 seconds]

Shift your attention to your mind… [pause 2 seconds]

[pause 3 seconds]

Notice what’s happening right now ! without needing to change it… [pause 3 seconds]

Are thoughts moving through?

[pause 3 seconds]

Maybe about what’s next…

[pause 3 seconds]

Or something that already happened? [pause 3 seconds]

Just let them be…..

[pause 3 seconds]

Observe them come and go, without getting involved… [pause 3 seconds]

If a thought stands out,, label it silently…

[pause 3 seconds]

And gently return to your breath. [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 3 seconds]

This small loop : notice, label, return; is the core of mental training… [pause 3 seconds]

Let’s try that together now…

Observing what arises,,,, and returning to the breath… [pause 2 seconds]

[pause 30 seconds]

If your attention drifted, that’s totally normal. [pause 2 seconds]

[pause 3 seconds]

Every time you catch yourself drifting and come back, that’s progress. [pause 3 seconds]

Take a slow, breath in… [pause 3 seconds] And out… [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 3 seconds]

Let your attention rest on this moment… [pause 3 seconds]

We’ll pause again, to watch thoughts rise and fall…

As you do, remember to gently label them “thinking” — and return to the breath. [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 45 seconds]

Stay with this focused attention for a moment longer… [pause 3 seconds]

If the practice felt a bit uncomfortable — that’s completely normal. [pause 1 seconds]

Distraction, restlessness, even boredom are all part of the process. [pause 3 seconds]

The real training is in noticing… and coming back. [pause 3 seconds]

Over time, this builds clarity, reduces stress, and strengthens your ability to focus. [pause 3 seconds]

In future sessions, we’ll explore more tools and techniques to help you stay calm, sharp, and present in daily life. [pause 3 seconds]

Now, slowly bring your attention back to your body…

[pause 3 seconds]

Notice any sensations — the weight of your body, the contact with the surface beneath you…

Take a deep breath in… [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 2 seconds]

And out… [pause 3 seconds]

[pause 3 seconds]

If it feels natural, you can open your eyes…

Or stay in this space a little longer, if you’d like. [pause 3 seconds]

Thanks for practicing today.

[pause 1 seconds]

We’ll continue the journey tomorrow ! [pause 3 seconds]
